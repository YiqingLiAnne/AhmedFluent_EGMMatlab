# AhmedbodyFluent_EGMMatlab
This is an in-house framework to implement the optimizer developed by 'matlab' to the flow control problem computed by the commercial software 'fluent'.
## Demo
We provide an example of online aerodynamic optimization of Ahmed body with explorative gradient method based on this matlab-fluent framework.
## Folder structure
* 'Ahby_rans/' includes journal filesto run fluent by command, 'Jou/', and the cfd cases of Ahmed body, 'CasDat/', which you can contact us to provide.
* 'EGM/' is the source code of 'explorative gradient method'.
* 'EGM/Plant/' includes the parameter and optimization problem setup for Ahmed body.
